🚀 Feature Ideas for Pythonic
Based on your library's capabilities, here are some exciting feature ideas:

1. Interactive Mode
Add keyboard controls during animation (pause/resume with spacebar, speed up/slow down with +/-)
Mouse click to inspect values at specific points
Real-time parameter adjustment
2. Plot Types Expansion
Bar charts - Animated bar graphs with Braille rendering
Scatter plots - Point clouds with different markers
Heatmaps - 2D intensity maps using Unicode blocks
Histograms - Real-time updating histograms
Polar plots - Circular coordinate system
3. Multi-Figure Layout
Subplots - Grid of multiple independent figures (2x2, 3x1, etc.)
Split screen - Synchronized animations side by side
Dashboard mode - Multiple plots updating independently
4. Export Features
GIF export - Export animations as animated GIFs directly
SVG export - Vector graphics output for documentation
ANSI to HTML - Convert terminal output to styled HTML
5. Data Source Integration
Live data plotting - Plot from stdin, files, or sockets in real-time
CSV/JSON import - Load data from files easily
Streaming mode - Continuous data feed plotting
6. Visual Enhancements
Grid lines - Optional background grid
Annotations - Text labels at specific points
Markers - Highlight specific data points
Fill/area under curve - Shaded regions between curves
Gradient colors - Color transitions along curves
7. Math/Scientific Features
FFT visualization - Show frequency spectrum
Phase space plots - 2D parametric animations
Vector fields - Arrow plots for derivatives/gradients
3D surface plots - Isometric projection rendering
8. Performance & Quality
Double buffering - Smoother animations with less flicker
Adaptive resolution - Auto-scale based on terminal size
