# Pythonic C++ Library

Welcome! Pythonic is a modern C++20 library that brings the expressive power and clean syntax of Python to C++. It aims to make C++ code feel as natural and productive as Python, while retaining the performance and flexibility of C++.

## What is Pythonic?

**Pythonic** is a C++ library designed for developers who love Python's dynamic features but need the speed and control of C++. It provides:

- Dynamic typing and flexible containers
- Python-style slicing, comprehensions, and string methods
- Easy-to-use data structures (list, dict, set, etc.)
- Graph algorithms, math utilities, and more
- A familiar, readable syntax—no weird hacks, just clean C++

## Why use this library?

- Write C++ code that feels like Python—concise, readable, and expressive
- Rapid prototyping and algorithm development in C++
- Seamless integration with modern C++ projects
- Great for teaching, competitive programming, and research

## User Guides & Documentation

- For a complete step-by-step guide on cloning, building, installing, and using this library in your own project, see the detailed [Getting Started Guide](docs/examples/README.md).
- **Note:** If you don't want to install, you can simply add the `include/pythonic` directory to your project's include path and use `target_include_directories` in your CMakeLists.txt.
- For a detailed user guide, [check out the documentation](docs/index.md).
