# Containers

Lists, dicts, sets, ordered variants.

Contents:

- `List` (std::vector<var>) — creation, indexing, append/extend/insert/pop/remove, slicing
- `Dict` (unordered_map<string,var>) — creation, access, `contains`, iteration
- `Set` / `OrderedSet` — semantics and iteration order
- `OrderedDict` — ordered map usage
- Operators: concatenation, union/intersection/difference where applicable
- `as_span()` and when to use it
- Truthiness rules for containers

Examples and performance notes.
