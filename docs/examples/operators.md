# Operators and Examples

Covers operator behavior with worked examples:

- Arithmetic promotion examples (`int + double`, `uint + int`)
- String operators: concatenation and repetition (`s * n`) with examples
- Container operators: list/dict unions and set operations
- Edge cases: division by zero, negative repetition, overflow examples

Include small code snippets and expected `TypeTag` outcomes.
